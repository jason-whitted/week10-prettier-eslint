# Linting

The `prettier` library is nice for some simple, fast formatting; however, JavaScript can be much more tricky to write.

Many code reviews are the same things over and over:

- simple gotchas in your code
- enforcing coding standards
- etc.

It would be great if we could have someone or something looking over our shoulder as we write code and suggest areas of improvement as we are typing.
