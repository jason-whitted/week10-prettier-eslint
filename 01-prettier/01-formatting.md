# Formatting

Whitespace doesn't matter.

*Right?*

Whitespace is ignored by the interpreter.

Most companies minify/uglify their code before it reaches production.

> Uglification is the process where the code is compressed to yield the smallest file size possible.  Whitespace is removed, variables and functions are renamed, etc.

Therefore, nobody in the business world is going to care at all about whitespace in your code.

*Right?*

***WRONG!***

Successful developers had to learn over time to become extremely anal retentive.  They learned what works for them and what doesn't.

Seasoned developers are constantly interacting with old code or other people's code, whether that be from maintenance, adding new features, tracking down bugs, or simply code reviews.

As soon as you open an existing file you are at a disadvantage. **Reading code is hard!**

If the file is formatted differently from what the developer is used to seeing then this causes additional cognitive load.  And their "anal retentive" brains immediately latch on to simple formatting issues rather than actual logic problems.

At some point a business will decide to code formatting rules into an official Coding Standards document.  These will outline line length, whitespace usage, line endings, semicolon usage, where wavy braces are located, when to use parenthesis and when not, etc.

## Example: Tabs vs. Spaces

If there is this much controversy over tabs vs. spaces you can only imagine how much debate could happen over creating a coding standards document.

But coding standards are important.  When everybody's code looks the same it is easier to read, maintain, and collaborate.
