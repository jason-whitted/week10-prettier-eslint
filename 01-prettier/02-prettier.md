The `prettier` library is opinionated, which means it doesn't care about any particular developer's argument about any single coding standard that it enforces.  Additionally, most options are not configurable.

This rigidity may sound like a fault for `prettier`, but this library has really taken off in the JavaScript community.

But why?

1. Single library with very little configuration
2. Majority of the settings are based on the  concensus from the community
3. Resulting code looks consistent, not just within a business, but even across various open source projects
